## Reporting Issues

If you find any bugs or have a feature request, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.
Before submitting an issue, please:
- Check the issue tracker to ensure the bug has not already been reported.
- Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.

## Pull Requests

- All Pull Requests will be reviewed, but please be patient, 
as the project is managed in my own time. 
Your contributions are valued, and I will review your suggestions 
as promptly as possible.
- For substantial changes, please open an issue first to discuss 
what you would like to change. This helps others on the project to 
have a background discussion before you invest a significant effort 
into a Pull Request.

## Getting Help
If you have any questions or need help with your contributions, please feel free to open an issue with a question tag, and we'll do our best to provide guidance.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Credder! We look forward to your contributions.
